* Make a PM communications roadmap doc explaining this work we are doing, link up with other publishing work.
* Launch theme on pantheon (cannabis, drought, etc.)
* <meta name="viewport"> is missing

## 0.1+
* - [X] Create [issue board](https://github.com/orgs/cagov/projects/22)
* Figure out sprint structure
* Goal: a WordPress theme that works monolithically and headlessly implementing the latest design system. (In progress)
* Connect useful settings and configurations for headless & monolith sites. (In progress)
* Improve editor visual parity & design system brand / site recognition & maybe UX for stressed out PIOs.
* IDEA: Eventually create this as a parent theme (no dependencies & freeing up a theme spot for agencies to add new features to propose to the design system.)
